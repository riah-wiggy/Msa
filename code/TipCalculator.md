## Program Requirements
- Prompt the user to enter the cost of the meal: "How much was the meal? "
- Prompt the user to enter the tip amount as a decimal: "What percentage would you like to tip? "
- Calculate the tip amount
- Display the tip amount to the user: Example - "Leave $3.50"
- Your program should have a main method

## Hints
- The inputs will come in as strings and you wil need to convert to the appropriate data type. (integer or float)
- It may be best to use string interpolation to print the output message to the user
- You can write one function to get both user inputs
